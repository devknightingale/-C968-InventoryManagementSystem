Project file for the C968 Performance Assessment. 

Comments throughout the files are sometimes to be deleted as they are reminders or explanations of what I need to do next. 
I thought it would be helpful to have a repository that would track it from the beginning including these notes as it would show my thought process while learning how to build the project. 
As of writing this readme on 05/06/24, I have already encountered several hurdles that I had to seek out how to do certain things. 
In other places, I found different ways to do things that may have to be revisited as they may not pass evaluation. (See: The way I implemented data validation at this point, with keeping the save button disabled until the validation passes rather than showing a message box.) 

I hope in the future this can be used as evidence of growth.
